# Regression Project

This project was done for ISyE 6414: Regression Analysis.

This project used the European Social Survey to create an Ordinal Logistic Regression model to find explanatory socio-economic variables for happiness.

# Abstract 

Subjective happiness is important for human beings. Our project focus on
explore how political attitude and behavior influence subjective happiness based on the
data set of European Social Survey. As the response variable is ordinal variable, we
apply Ordinal Logistic Regression in our research. Modeling upon the whole data set
(~42k observations), we get a full model in which almost all variables are statistically
significant. Considering the size of the data set, we apply subsampling method to do
variable selection and to check the significance of different explanatory variables in
order to achieve more robust results. Based on the results from subsampling, we find
that individual’s confidence in own ability to participate in politics, general satisfaction on
social environment and the degree of political behavior involvement have positive effect
on happiness, while participants’ general trust to political entities has negative effect on
their subjective happiness.
